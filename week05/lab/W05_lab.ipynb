    "### More information about files and paths\n",
    "Most of the time when we are doing any kind of data analysis, we will need to read data from a file.  The main kind of file we have seen so far is a \"plain text\" file that contains, you guessed it, text. What distinguished plain text files from files like PDFs or MS Word files is that plain text files only contain text; they don't contain any formatting information.  This makes them a lot easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below also make use of the fact that files are often organized and stored in different folders.  If we want to open a file stored in a different folder, then we need to use the full \"path\" to the file. As an analogy, if I'm in the Bahen building and I want to find an office that is also in the Bahen building, all I need to know is the office number (the file name).  But if I want to find our classroom, then I need to know that it is in the Student Union building (the folder) in room B120 (the file name)."
