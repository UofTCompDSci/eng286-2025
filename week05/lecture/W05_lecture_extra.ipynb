    "We probably won't have time to cover this in lecture, but it's potentially fun for those of you who are interested.\n",

    "### Note: None of this Digression (Part 1 or Part 2) will be on the midterm or the exam. It is not something we require you to know. It's just for fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will need some cool new Regex characters:\n",
    "* `.`: \"any character except a newline\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And this \"quantifier\" which you add to a regular expression to signal\n",
    "* `*`: \"zero or more occurences of the thing immediately to my left\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So that the expression\n",
    "* `.*` means \"zero or more characters other than a newline\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To catch one-line quotations, one could try...\n",
    "* `\".*\"`: a `\"` character, followed by zero or more occurences of any character except a newline, followed by a `\"` character \n",
    "\n",
    "This actually won't work on *The Sign of the Four* ‚Äî becuase it's from Project Gutenberg, and PG files use ‚Äúcurly quotes.‚Äù **Yes: `\"` and `‚Äú` and `‚Äù` are all actually different characters**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to use ‚Äúcurly quotes‚Äù for Project Gutenberg files. And we got *The Sign of the Four* from PG. So we need:\n",
    "* `‚Äú.*‚Äù`: a `‚Äú` character, followed by zero or more occurences of any character except a newline, followed by a `‚Äù` character \n",
    "\n",
    "We need one added complexity: the searches are \"greedy\" (they grab as much as they can), so they sometimes add narration in between the opening and closing quotes. We can fix this by specifying that if you see a close-quote character, immediately stop. The regular expression we need is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `‚Äú[^‚Äù]*‚Äù` ‚Äî where the `[^‚Äù]` means \"any character except a close quote\""
