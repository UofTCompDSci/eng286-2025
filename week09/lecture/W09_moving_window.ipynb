    "## Week 9: Defining Functions and Moving Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing our TTR calculations, we learned that the non-standardized TTRs can't be compared to each other because the value of the TTR is highly dependent of the length of the text.  This is due to the fact that langauges include connective words that are repeated many times, so longer texts will have smaller TTR values than shorter texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We addressed this issue by standardizing the texts so that each text we want to compare is the same length. Our method of standardizing was to find the smallest text and then truncate each text to that size.  This means that our TTR anlyses have only evaluated the first part of many texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a clear question here, whether the TTR of the first portion of a text is a reasonable representation of the TTR of the full text. In other words, would we get a substantially different TTR value if we chose a different portion of the text to compute the TTR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into this question further, by looking at the concept of moving averages.  But before we get to moving averages, we need to know how to write a function.\n",
    "\n",

    "You already know how to use functions.  Examples of functions that we have used are `print()`, `len()`, `type()`.  You can define your own function using the syntax below. There are two main reasons to write functions:\n",
    "- To package up a set of operations so that you don't have to think about the details\n",
    "- To package up a set of operations that will be repeated with different arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions take one or more \"arguments\". The argument to `len()` is the object (string or list) that we want to find the length of.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also often \"return\" a value that we can assign to a variable or use in other ways.  The function `len()` returns an integer that is the length of the argument.\n",
    "\n",

    "But let's get back to the question of a moving window to compute an average TTR for a given window size. The window size is the number of tokens we will use to investigate, and we shift the window across the list of tokens and compute the TTR for each step.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "- First window is `['one', 'fish', 'two']` which has a 3 types.\n",
    "- Second window is `['fish', 'two', 'fish']` which has 2 types\n",
    "- Third winodw is `['two', 'fish', 'red']` which has 3 types\n",
    "- Fourth window is `['fish', 'red', 'fish']` which has 2 types\n",
    "- Fifth window is `['red', 'fish', 'blue']` which has 3 types\n",
    "- Sixth window is `['fish', 'blue', 'fish']` which has 2 types\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now compute the average of the types to get the average TTR with a window size of 3 which is 83.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be computed in a few different ways.  Here are two:\n",
    "- Average of the TTRs: `(3/3 + 2/3 + 3/3 + 2/3 + 3/3 + 2/3) /6 * 100`\n",
    "- Average the types and then compute the TTR: `(3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2)/ (3 * 6) * 100`\n",

    "The purpose of this example is to illustrate a moving window, but we can start to think about what useful window sizes might be."
